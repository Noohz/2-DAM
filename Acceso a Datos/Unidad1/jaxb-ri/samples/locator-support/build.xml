  <description>
        This sample shows how to use the new non-standard locator support.  By 
        following the instructions in the readme.txt file, you can cause all of 
        the generated impl classes to implement a new interface that provides 
        more information about error locations.  When a ValidationEvent happens 
        on your content tree, simply retrieve the object and cast it down to 
        &lt;tt&gt;com.sun.xml.bind.extra.Locatable&lt;/tt&gt;.
